Use libgphoto2 to control a tethered camera.
Fork of defunct project 'piggyphoto' by Alex Dumitrache

i've cleaned it up quiet a bit, and added patches that were left in pull
requests, but much is still untested

currently supported on linux and python 2.7


Supports
--------
- Capturing images, previews
- Probably more, but totally untested


Goals
-----
- python 3 support
- unit tests, someday
- remove all the cruft!
- more 'pythonic' interface
